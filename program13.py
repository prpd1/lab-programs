#A milk vendor buys milk at the rate of 3.25/lt then adds a litre of water for every
#4 litres of milk and sells the water milk at the rate of 4.15/lt. Calculate the gain
#for milk vendor.

milk_rate = 3.25
actual_milk_rate = 4*milk_rate
mil_rate_with_water = 5*4.15
gain = (mil_rate_with_water )-(actual_milk_rate)
print(f'gain is {gain}')
